# Atlas-Data-Mining

The objective of this analysis was to develop the most suitable model to explain the proportion of individuals living in poverty by municipality in Brazil (POB), based on the various attributes recorded for each municipality in the 2010 Census. To this end, a regression model was formulated. Given that the response variable is continuous and bounded within the interval (0,1), a limited dependent variable regression model is more appropriate than a traditional linear regression model for these data.

This project presents the complete analysis, including data description and a detailed, step-by-step development of the models, culminating in the final conclusions. The code and its corresponding explanations are available in the notebook Projeto_Atlas_Brasil.ipynb.
